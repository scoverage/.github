# Getting Started

One way to get started is to watch Chris's [talk][] on Scala 3.

Afterwards you probably want to take a look at the README for
the [scalac-scoverage-plugin][] and your build plugin of choice.

If it is `sbt` you can also take a look at the [sbt-examples][]
and the `scripted` tests in the [sbt-scoverage][] repo.

If you have questions, please feel free to reachout on [Gitter][].
